You can create separate Docker Compose files and Dockerfiles for your development and production environments. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Docker Compose**: Create a base `docker-compose.yml` file and a `docker-compose.override.yml` file for your development environment. Docker Compose automatically reads both files and merges their contents when you run `docker-compose up`. For your production environment, create a `docker-compose.prod.yml` file. You can use this file by running `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up`.

2. **Dockerfile**: Create separate Dockerfiles for your development and production environments, such as `Dockerfile.dev` and `Dockerfile.prod`. In your Docker Compose files, you can specify which Dockerfile to use for each service:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml / docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  myservice:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev

# docker-compose.prod.yml
services:
  myservice:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.prod
```

With this setup, you can use different configurations, dependencies, and build steps for your development and production environments.
